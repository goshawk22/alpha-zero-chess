# Alpha-Zero-Chess
Playing the game Chess using Alpha-Zero techniques in Python

Run main.py to start training.
Run pit.py to play to agents together.

Currently it takes ~10 minutes to play an episode which, without multithreading and low end hardware, makes training too slow to be viable and see results.

This branch currently does NOT work.
